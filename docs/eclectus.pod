=head1 Eclectus

Eclectus aims to be a Scheme to PIR compiler implemented in Scheme.
It is based on Abdulaziz Ghuloums compiler tutorial.

=head1 Status

Still at step 1.

=head1 Testing

Tests are written in Scheme. The test-driver is derived from the tutorial, 
tweaked to emit TAP.
There are Perl 5 wrappers for the scheme test scripts, in order to allow
unified languages testing.

The F<t/*.pl> scripts are used in unified languages testing. They
are executing the respective F<t/*.t> Scheme scripts. In
unified languages testing the Eclectus tests are skipped, when
the is no 'petite 7.3' around.

=head1 TODO

- Add a proper check whether 'petite' is installed.
- In the longterm, Eclectus should become self-hosting
